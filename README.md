# Project README

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for this project, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t echorus:latest .
```

This command will create a Docker image tagged as `echorus:latest`.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 echorus
```

This command will start a new container from the `echorus:latest` image.

## Making a request

Once the container is up, you can open [this link](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to see the autogenerated docs for the APIs.
